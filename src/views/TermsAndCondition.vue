intended to be deemed, nor shall it cause, either you or Luso Digital Assets to be
treated as partners or joint ventures, or either you or Luso Digital Assets to be
treated as the agent of the other.
              </p><p align="justify"><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Privacy of Others</strong> - If you receive information about another user through the
Luso Digital Assets Services, you must keep the information confidential and only
use it in connection with the Luso Digital Assets Services. You may not disclose
or distribute a user’s information to a third party or use the information except as
reasonably necessary to carry out a transaction and other functions reasonably

the appropriate tax authorities. Your transaction history is available through your

              </p><p align="justify"><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Unclaimed Property</strong> - If we hold Digital Currency on your behalf, and we are
unable to contact you and have no record of your use of the Luso Digital Assets
Services for several years, applicable law may require us to report the Digital
Currency as unclaimed property to the authorities in certain jurisdictions. We will
try to locate you at the address shown in our records, but if we are unable to, we
may be required to deliver any such Digital Currency to the authorities in certain

applicable law.
              </p><p align="justify"><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Death of Account Holder</strong> - For security reasons, if we receive legal
documentation confirming your death or other information leading us to believe
you have died, we will freeze your Luso Digital Assets Account and during this
time, no transactions may be completed until: (i) your designated executor /
trustee has opened a new Luso Digital Assets Account or informed Luso Digital
Assets about another, existing, Luso Digital Assets Account in their name, as
further described below, and the entirety of your Luso Digital Assets Account has
been transferred to such new account, or (ii) we have received proof in a form
satisfactory to us that you have not died. If we have reason to believe you may
have died but we do not have proof of your death in a form satisfactory to us, you
authorize us to make inquiries, whether directly or through third parties, that we
consider necessary to ascertain whether you have died. Upon receipt by us of
proof satisfactory to us that you have died, the executor / trustee you have
designated in a valid Will or similar testamentary document will be required to
open a new Luso Digital Assets Account or inform Luso Digital Assets of another,
existing Luso Digital Assets Account in their name, to which the entirety of the
funds in your Luso Digital Assets Account shall be transferred. If you have not
designated an executor / trustee, then we reserve the right to (i) treat as your
executor / trustee any person entitled to inherit your Luso Digital Assets Account,
as determined by us upon receipt and review of the documentation we, in our
sole and absolute discretion, deem necessary or appropriate, including (but not
limited to) a Will or similar document, or (ii) require an order designating an
executor / trustee from a court having competent jurisdiction over your estate. In
the event we determine, in our sole and absolute discretion, that there is
uncertainty regarding the validity of the executor / trustee designation, we reserve
the right to require an order resolving such issue from a court of competent
jurisdiction before taking any action relating to your Luso Digital Assets Account.
Pursuant to the above, unless your designated executor / trustee already holds a
Luso Digital Assets Account (in which case they may still be required to undergo
additional identity verification procedures), the opening of a new Luso Digital
Assets Account by a designated executor / trustee is mandatory following the
death of a Luso Digital Assets Account owner, and you hereby agree that your
executor / trustee will be required to open a new Luso Digital Assets Account and
provide the information required to conclude the onboarding process in order to
gain access to the contents of your Luso Digital Assets Account.

Enforcement of Our Rights - We may not always strictly enforce our rights
under this Terms. If we do choose not to enforce our rights at any time, this is a
